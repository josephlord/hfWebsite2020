# Steps to setup Feather, in Docker using sqlite with an Nginx reverse proxy, SSL using LetsEncrypt on Ubuntu (Testest on Digital Ocean)
# Steps not tested in order yet, may do that but I'm not promising. I may also snapshot the build Droplet and just copy what I want to a small Droplet without the build tools, not sure yet.
# Note if you are building you might want to size your Droplet up for the build process and then size it back down when you are done. I think you can scale within a category without issue
# on Digital Ocean. Initially create the size you want then you can resize without changing the disk size and if you do it that way you can change back down after the build.
